=========

Gunn Apps is a central repository of information and software, by students for students (of `Gunn High School <http://gunn.pausd.org>`_). It provides a central database of basic student information that is exposed via an open API to all sorts of developers.
If you're interested in helping out, contact `Ankit <mailto:me@ankit.io>`_ or send by a pull request. Documentation of the API should be up shortly.
